The Bot uses configuration files stored in the Ainseybot/Configuration Directory.
It is written in an INI format as this makes it quite easy to read and edit.

it is split up into sections, the name of each section shouldn't be changed and is wrapped with [ ].
inside each section, on a line per variable basis, is the configuration itself.

its fairly easy to work out what is what, I haven't put comments in the ini file, so the purpose of each section / variable will be noted in here.

[BotConnectionParams]

This is the main bit that will get changed. It is the home to the details the bot uses to connect into the given irc server.

Server - This is the server IP / Hostname that the bot will connect to

Port - This is the port that the server connects to, default is 6667

Channel - The channel your bot should connect to

Nick - This is the nickname that the bot presents itself as when connecting to the server

AdminName - this is your nick, the bot will only respond to administration commands from this user.

ExitMessage - This is the message the bot passes when it exits / leaves the channel.
